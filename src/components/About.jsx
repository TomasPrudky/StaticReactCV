            Hi, my name is Tomas Prudky. I graduated in 2023 with a Master's degree in Information 
            Technology from the University of Pardubice. I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Information 
            Technology at this school. I also studied information technology with a focus on programming in high school.

            During my studies, I mainly used the Java language, which is also the language I am 
            currently programming in. I have also encountered languages such as C, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript, 
            Python, SQL, R and MATLAB. Database systems used during my studies would include MySQL, PostgreSQL 
            and also Oracle SQL. Other technologies worth mentioning are SQL/PLSQL, HTML and CSS, Spring Boot, 
            Hibernate, GIT, SVN, Docker, ELK Stack, MUI, Vaadin, Tailwind CSS or REACT.

            In my free time I like to play sports. I actively play soccer, but I also like to run or work out. 
            Recently, chess has also become my hobby. Sometimes I like to play a game on the computer with my friends. 
            When there is more time I like to travel with my girlfriend. Last but not least, 
            I like good food and I also like to cook, either for myself or for others.
